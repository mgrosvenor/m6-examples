# test.sh — end-to-end test for example 05, the CMS blog.
#
# This is the example that runs the whole stack: m6-http at the edge, m6-html for
# templates, m6-file for assets, m6-md for markdown, m6-auth-server for logins,
# and render-cms as a custom renderer. So this is the suite that checks the
# system rather than one service, and it is the one to run before believing that
# a change to m6 did no harm.
#
# Start the stack first:  ./dev.sh
#
# Usage:
#   ./test.sh                      against https://127.0.0.1:8443
#   ./test.sh --addr HOST:PORT     against a different address
#   ./test.sh --user U --pass P    different credentials (default admin/admin)
#
# ── There are no skips ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every check has exactly one expected answer. The previous version of this file
# had five that accepted a range -- "302 or 401 or 403", "may require a valid
# token", "session may persist on server" -- and each one was hiding something:
#
#   - a check that passed on either answer reported the post-logout state as
#     fine while never establishing what it was
#   - `GET /auth/refresh` was reported as a possible token problem. The endpoint
#     is POST-only, so the GET was a 404 and always would be
#   - the token check used `grep -oP`, a GNU extension. On macOS that is
#     "invalid option -- P", so it printed "token not found, may use httpOnly"
#     on every run of a working server
#
# A check that cannot fail is not a check. If something here cannot be
# established, it fails and says so.
#
# ── What is deliberately not covered ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   - HTTP/3, because the system curl has no h3. m6's own conformance suite
#     covers h3 against h3spec.
#   - Real SMTP. The contact form's POST path is exercised; delivery is not.
#   - TLS certificate validation: -k throughout, because these are mkcert certs.
