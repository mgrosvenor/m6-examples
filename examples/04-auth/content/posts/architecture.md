You could build what m6 does from parts: a Markdown converter, a template engine, a reverse proxy, a caching layer, an auth service. nginx, Varnish, PHP, Pandoc — the parts exist. People have been assembling them for decades. Each piece is well-understood in isolation.

The problem is the seams. Every integration point is a configuration file in a different format, a different concept of what a "route" is, a different way to invalidate a cache, a different log format, a different security model. The tools don't share a mental model, so you carry several of them simultaneously. Debugging means knowing which layer ate the request. Optimising means understanding five different caching models.

m6 is a different approach. It's an integrated system that thinks about the whole stack — from authoring pages in Markdown to writing bytes to a network socket — and handles all of it under one roof, with a single set of concepts, a single config format, and a unified model of how content moves from source to browser.

The integration is what makes the developer experience simpler. It's also what makes the system fast: because the cache layer knows exactly which content files each URL depends on, it can evict precisely and immediately when content changes, with no TTLs and no wasted work. Because the rendering layer speaks directly to the cache layer's expectations, responses arrive already compressed and ready to serve. No adapter overhead, no translation, no impedance mismatch.

This is still a collection of small Unix processes. Each has one job. They communicate over Unix sockets. You wire them together with a config file. But the point isn't the processes — the point is that the whole journey, from the Markdown file on disk to the bytes on the wire, is a single coherent system.

## The processes

**m6-http** is the only process that listens on a public port. Its primary job — the one that determines real-world performance — is its **in-memory response cache**. Most requests in production never reach a backend at all. m6-http serves them directly from RAM: a complete HTTP response, fully rendered, already compressed to brotli or gzip, with all headers pre-formed. On a cache hit, m6-http does nothing except write bytes to the network socket.

On a cache miss, m6-http routes the request to the appropriate backend pool, gets a rendered response back, stores it in the cache if the response is cacheable, and returns it to the client. Subsequent requests for the same resource hit the cache.

m6-http also terminates TLS, enforces route-level authentication, and fetches styled error pages from m6-html when backends fail. It does not start, stop, or monitor other processes — that's systemd's job.

**m6-html** renders HTML from Tera templates and JSON data files. Each instance listens on a Unix socket. Its entire application logic is: match path → load params files → merge global params → render template → compress → respond. No database, no sessions, no side effects.

**m6-file** serves files from the filesystem. Similar socket convention to m6-html, but no templates, no params. Just path resolution with traversal protection and content-type detection.

**m6-auth** issues and verifies JWTs, manages credentials and ACLs. m6-http verifies tokens locally using m6-auth's public key — no network hop per request. m6-auth is only called for credential operations: login, token refresh, logout, user and group management.

**User-supplied renderers** are ordinary HTTP/1.1+ servers. Declared as backends in `site.toml`. Managed by systemd. The m6-render Rust library makes writing them simple, but any language works.

## Tiers

m6 sites fall into three tiers based on what you actually need:

**Tier 1 — Static.** m6-http + m6-html + m6-file. Templates, configs, assets, and hand-authored JSON. No build step. Deployed by copying files. This covers a lot of ground: marketing sites, documentation, portfolios.

**Tier 2 — Generated static.** Same as tier 1, but content JSON is produced by an external tool. `m6-md` converts Markdown files with TOML frontmatter into the `{ "documents": [...] }` format m6-html expects. Other tools can produce the same format. m6 itself has no opinion about where the JSON came from.

**Tier 3 — Dynamic.** User-supplied renderers handle routes that require custom logic — form submissions, APIs, CMSes, anything with mutable state. These are independent HTTP servers wired in as backends. m6 provides routing, caching, auth enforcement, and error handling around them.

## The cache

This is the source of m6's performance. Every cacheable response is stored in RAM as a complete, ready-to-send unit:

- The rendered HTML (or file bytes), already compressed to brotli or gzip
- All HTTP response headers, pre-formed
- The status code

On a cache hit, m6-http writes this blob directly to the network socket. No rendering, no compression, no template lookup, no file read, no allocation. The backend processes aren't contacted at all. For a typical static page or blog post, the effective server latency is measured in microseconds.

```
Cache hit path:
  request → cache lookup → write bytes to socket

Cache miss path:
  request → route match → backend → render → compress → cache → write to socket
```

**Cache key:** `(path, content-encoding)`. Query strings are stripped before lookup. Each encoding variant — brotli, gzip, identity — is cached independently. If a brotli-capable client is first, the brotli variant is cached. The next gzip-only client gets a fresh render, which is then cached as a separate entry.

**What gets cached:** Responses with `Cache-Control: public`. `no-store` and `private` are not cached. 4xx and 5xx responses are never cached regardless of headers.

**Invalidation without TTLs:** m6-http builds an invalidation map at startup from data files to the URL paths that depend on them, derived from `params` declarations in renderer configs. When a data file changes on disk (detected via inotify), the map lookup gives m6-http exactly which cached URLs to evict — and only those. No sweep, no TTL expiry, no full-cache wipe.

`site.toml` is the sync point. Touching it triggers a full reload of routing, pool membership, the auth config, and the invalidation map. External tools that update content touch `site.toml` to signal m6-http. The cache is evicted for affected routes; everything else remains cached.

## Backend pools and socket discovery

The socket glob in `site.toml` is the only configuration m6-http needs for a backend:

```toml
[[backend]]
name    = "m6-html"
sockets = "/run/m6/m6-html-*.sock"
```

m6-http watches `/run/m6/` via inotify. When a socket matching the glob appears, it's added to the pool. When it disappears, it's removed. Load balancing is least-connections across active pool members. Scaling up means starting a new systemd unit — no config change, no reload.

Backends are only contacted on cache misses. A well-configured site with stable content will see backends contacted rarely — once per content version, per URL.

## Auth

Routes declare `require`:

```toml
[[route]]
path    = "/admin"
backend = "m6-html"
require = "group:admins"
```

m6-http verifies the JWT locally using m6-auth's public key — no network call on the hot path. The token is checked before the request reaches any renderer. Renderers can perform additional fine-grained checks via the auth extensions in m6-render.

## Hot reload

Nothing in m6 requires a restart for content changes. m6-http reloads config on `site.toml` change. Pool membership updates automatically as sockets appear and disappear. TLS certificates reload on file change. The whole system is designed to be operated without interruption.

## Logging

Every process logs structured JSON to stdout. systemd captures it via journald. No log files in the site directory. No log rotation. No separate log daemon. `journalctl -u m6-http -f` is the interface.

## Why one integrated system?

You could build something equivalent from separate tools — nginx as the proxy, Varnish as the cache, a template engine for rendering, a Markdown converter for content, a separate auth library. The parts exist and are individually excellent.

The cost is the integration surface. Each tool has its own config format, its own concept of a route, its own caching model, its own log format. Getting them to work together means writing glue, and debugging means knowing which layer handled (or dropped) each request.

m6 trades that flexibility for coherence. Because all the pieces share a common design — the same socket convention, the same config format, the same model of what a route is — the integration just works. The cache can be precise about eviction because the renderer's config declares exactly which data files each route depends on. The file watcher knows what to watch because the route table tells it. None of this requires configuration or glue.

## Why Unix processes rather than a monolith?

The separate-process architecture isn't about flexibility for its own sake — it's about operational simplicity. Each process has one job, its own resource accounting, and its own restart boundary. A broken renderer doesn't take down the cache. Scaling a hot renderer means starting another instance; m6-http discovers the new socket via the file watcher and adds it to the pool with no config change.

The boundary between components is HTTP/1.1 over a Unix socket — utterly conventional. You can replace any component with anything that speaks that protocol. The m6-render library makes writing custom renderers in Rust straightforward, but any language works.
